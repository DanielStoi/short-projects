# short projects

contains some non trivial short projects which implements some idea or concept. Contains around 60-200 lines of code each. Projects also have an additional paragraph at start expaining their operation.


## description of some of the projects:

### modular arithmetic sorting compiler
* generates a C program that is capable of sorting integers greater or equal to 1, through only math operations(mod,divide,multiply,plus,minus), without any if, while statement or any other conditional operators.
* however one should note that the size of the program generated grows exponentially as the amount of integers being sorted increases
* blatant inefficencies in the generated code
* order_5_Natural_numbers_through_math_operations.c was created through this program as an example

### functions
word_processing_to_create_function and circuit_simulator take in a specific format of information(strs, and nested lists +ints and strs respectively) and processes them to the proper corresponding function. Program can then be run with different inputs, either being different numerical values for the variables or a different combination of 1's and 0's as boolean values, both of which generate a corresponding answer in each program.

### n^2 - n^2 sukodu solver
solves a sudoku puzzle of any valid size from input. Puzzle has n^2 rows, columns and "boxes" which must have different numbers within.

### tic tac toe
* can change how much consecutive X's or O's to win
* can change board size
* no proper UI, instead text based
