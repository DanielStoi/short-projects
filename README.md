# short projects
contains some short projects that that usually are meant to implement an idea or concept. Im not planning to stick to a specific area or programming language.


## description of some of the projects:

### tic tac toe
* can change how much consecutive X's or O's to win
* can change board size
* no proper UI, instead text

### maths operation sorting program generator
* generates a C program that is capable of sorting integers greater or equal to 1, through only math operations(mod,divide,multiply,plus,minus), without any if, while statement or any other conditional operators. Based off a UNSW challenge exercise.
* however one should note that the size of the program generated grows exponentially as the amount of integers being sorted increases
* batent inefficencies in the generated code
* order_5_Natural_numbers_through_math_operations.c was created through this program as an example
